<h1>1. Issue Summary</h1>
<p>Museum libraries have seen dwindling institutional support in the past decade. Work performed by librarians such as the construction of detailed bibliographies, research guides, and through providing access to their research collections, is creative work worthy of recognition as an important cultural contribution within art museums. In providing context for object collections and exhibitions, art museum libraries can demonstrate their value to the institutions they serve.</p>

<h2>Finding the Material:<br>
Collecting and Protecting Intellectual Property in Ephemeral Works of Art</h2>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
The 1976 Copyright Act outlines the criteria for protecting artists’ original creative work.
Contemporary, performative art practices often have no tangible enduring trace, and the
definition of creative work protected under the Copyright Act has major implications for iterative works of art such as performance or similar ephemeral installations. From a legal standpoint, there are no clear guidelines to direct an institution’s right to display and maintain performance or other conceptual, ephemeral works in its collection. Without a legal guide, institutions are faced with the task of creating a model for collecting work that has no clear guidelines for acquisition and display. Some work by artists whose practice is primarily ephemeral has been afforded a small amount of legal protection through photographs and videos, and materials that supplement performances and conceptual experiences. While few legal cases exist to set a precedent for protecting ephemeral works of art, we can look to examples in related media that point out shortcomings in the law. These contiguous precedents allow us to focus our attention when building protections for artists’ intellectual property and an institution’s right to display performance and ephemeral works in their collection. Ultimately, collecting institutions should collaborate with artists to define material properties of their ephemeral works of art and appropriate means of display and maintenance for posterity.<p>

<h1>7. Advising History</h1>
<br>
<h4>/ / Beverly Lynch</h4>
<p>My assigned advisor when I entered the MLIS program at UCLA in Fall 2017 was Beverly Lynch. Though my interests lie primarily in Art Librarianship, which did not seem to exactly align with Beverly’s expertise, her range of experience and particularly leadership roles within the LIS field gave me a lot of enthusiasm about our academic relationship. I met with her once in Fall 2017, and again in Winter 2018, and though I didn’t have much to talk about in terms of necessary guidance, Beverly’s encouragement left me with confidence in my goals and path forward. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / Miriam Posner</h4>

<p>In my first year of the MLIS program I took two courses with Miriam Posner:
<ul>
  <li>Systems & Infrastructures (IS 270), Winter 2018</li>
  <li>Museums in the Digital Age (IS 289-5), Spring 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>Her approach to teaching resonated with my way of learning, and I felt would be beneficial to the process of completing my course of study. Over Summer 2018 I requested to change advisors so that I could work more closely with Miriam in my second year in the MLIS program. In addition to responding thoughtfully to my numerous email check-ins, I met with Miriam four times. In broad terms, we discussed:
<ul>
  <li><b>Summer 2018 (August 21, 2018)</b><br>
  Fall 2018 class schedule; preliminary thoughts on my Issue Paper topic; and accommodations I would need for the 2018-19 school year</li>
  <li><b>Fall 2018 (October 10, 2018)</b><br>
  Further ideas for my Issue Paper; setting up a framework for working on my portfolio; Gerd Muehsam student paper award offered through ARLIS/NA</li>
  <li><b>Winter 2019 (February 5, 2019)</b><br> 
  Class schedule for Winter 2019; setting up expectations for Directed Individual Study for Winter 2019 to work on Issue Paper; planning for Spring 2019 classes</li>
  <li><b>Spring 2019 (April 5, 2019)</b><br>
  Portfolio contents and clarification on several components; Directed Individual Study for Spring 2019</li>
</ul>

<h4>Issue Paper</h4>
<p>At the end of Summer 2018 I began discussing my Issue Paper with Miriam. My topic was inspired by a panel discussion on art museum libraries I had attended at the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) conference. My in-person and emailed discussions with Miriam at the end of Summer and beginning of Fall 2018 helped to orient my thoughts so that I could begin research with a focus in mind. Over the course of Fall 2018 Miriam provided milestones for progress toward my Issue Paper. As my topic developed I realized I needed more time to follow my research and concentrate on constructing an argument, and Miriam agreed to oversee an independent study in Winter 2019 to facilitate this work. 

<h4>Various Projects</h4>
<p>Miriam provided crucial support for my aspirations outside of work toward specific assignments. Her feedback was incredibly helpful in applying for ARLIS/NA’s Gerd Muehsam student paper award, which I ultimately was honored to receive. Miriam has also agreed to oversee an additional independent study in Spring 2019 so that I can complete work on a project with Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, an artist-run non-circulating library and archive. 

<h4>Support for Personal Commitments</h4>
<p>I became a parent in Spring 2018 and my conversations with Miriam have been instrumental to finding the right balance with and motivation toward my academic and professional goals between new personal obligations. Miriam’s patience, kindness, flexibility and readiness to work with my demands as a new parent within academia have been just as integral to my success as an MLIS candidate as have her guidance in my creative and intellectual labor. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / UCLA Arts Librarians</h4>

<p>Over the course of my MLIS studies at UCLA I also worked as a Graduate Reference Assistant at the Arts Library. The librarians I worked with there—Robert Gore, Diana King, and particularly Janine Henri—have played an important role in providing guidance in my studies and professional development. In addition to sharing their vast knowledge on individual subject specializations, they have allowed me to assist in the coordination of exhibits, LibGuides, acquisitions, and instruction—all necessary skills as an early career librarian. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / UCLA MLIS Peers</h4>

<p>I believe there is much I can learn not only from established professionals but also from my peers, and with this in mind must also acknowledge the guidance and support I received from Karly Wildenhaus (UCLA MLIS 2018) and Lauren Molina (UCLA MLIS 2019). 

<p>Throughout the 2017-2018 school year Karly offered feedback and advice on courses relevant to my interests, encouraged me to become involved in the local chapter of ARLIS/NA and student group Artifacts, and to apply for professional development opportunities. With an educational and working background similar to my own, Karly’s perspective has been incredibly helpful, especially in challenging me to think outside my comfort zone. 

<p>Lauren and I worked closely and collaboratively throughout our two years of study. We took on two group projects together:
<ul>
  <li>living in Los Angeles, a digital library built on CONTENTdm (IS 260: Description & Access, Fall 2017)</li>
  <li>KNOW e-publishing, a proposal for a website built for the scholarly community to explain and discuss the implications of digital publishing (IS 213: Libraries and Their Social Role(s), Spring 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>and provided feedback on each others’ work over the course of our time in the MLIS program. Lauren provided key support and motivation to pursue and find the meaning in my ideas.

<div id="profdev"></div>
<h1>8. Professional Development Statement</h1>
<p>With an education in art history, curatorial practice and critical theory, I entered my MLIS course of study with a focus on Art Librarianship. My definition of Art Librarianship is a broad one, ranging from specific expertise within the context of art institutions, to bringing a creative approach to providing generalist services. I have an interest in working in a variety of contexts that reflect the broad approach to education I have engaged throughout the course of my MLIS training at UCLA. Coursework I have completed over the two years of the MLIS program has allowed me to focus on my specific interest in art librarianship while also providing training in skills and concepts that apply broadly to the LIS field. 

<p>After receiving an MA in Curatorial Practices in the Public Sphere from the USC Roski School of Fine Art in 2012, I worked professionally in many capacities related to organizing exhibitions and collections. I worked closely with artists to commission new work, and with municipalities to plan public art projects, organized installations and managed collections, and planned engagement events such as artist talks, concerts, and workshops. Through all of this, I often found myself asking questions about how work was conceptually framed—not only the reasons why, but also about the practical effects of framing practices within esoteric structures. 

<p>This line of inquiry began while pursuing my MA. While researching my master’s thesis, which focused on contemporary artistic practices that utilize cooking and instruction, I became fascinated with the various subjects and physical locations I was required to track down while compiling sources for my work. The practices I was writing about dealt with similar topics and approaches. Yet, the similarities among the artists whose practices I was researching had to be culled from various libraries on and off the USC campus, and disparate call numbers within each library. The lexicon of artists using recipes in the contemporary art world is brief, so I had many questions about how each instance of artwork, artistic practice or individual came to be cataloged so differently from each other.  

<p>As I became more critically engaged with the conceptual framework of the art my professional practice worked to present, I thought often of my graduate research and began considering continuing my education within the scope of information studies. Many of my colleagues in the contemporary art world have extensive interdisciplinary research-based practices, so it seemed to reason that an MLIS education would not only be rewarding to my personal interests but that a trained information professional with a background in contemporary art like myself could serve the needs of this community. 

<h4>Art Museum Libraries & Academic Art Librarianship</h4>
<p>When I entered the MLIS program at UCLA, I did so with the intended goal of working as a librarian within an art context. I have a particular interest in art museum libraries and their relationship to institutional curatorial practices, and wrote the issue paper included in this portfolio on the contributions librarians make within art museums. I also hold a great interest in the interdisciplinary possibilities of working within an academic library. In my time at UCLA I have worked as a Graduate Reference Desk Assistant at the UCLA Arts Library, and have enjoyed the opportunity to provide support for research questions from all levels of university researchers, from freshman to seasoned faculty. As part of my work at the Arts Library I worked closely with librarians specializing in visual and performing arts, new media and design. I was able to take on projects assisting with acquisitions, instruction, and creating an exhibition related to the campus-wide Common Book initiative. 

<h4>Special Collections</h4>
<p>I see many parallels between my professional work in the art world and the development and stewardship of Special Collections. Coursework I have completed in this specialty—History of Books and Literacy Technologies (Prof. Johanna Drucker, Winter 2018) and Special Collections Librarianship (Prof. Anna Chen, Director, Clark Library, Winter 2019)—has allowed me to develop projects that engage critically with the possibilities and limitations presented by Special Collections. The paper I wrote for Special Collections Librarianship makes a case for contemporary artists’ books as important engagement materials to facilitate greater access to Special Collections. Taking on these topics has strengthened my interest in working in this capacity, in particular working to create greater engagement with primary resources through exhibitions and outreach. 

<h4>Cataloging</h4>
<p>My questions related to conducting research for my MA were rooted in issues of cataloging, and the opportunity to complete coursework in Descriptive and Subject Cataloging (Winter 2019 and Spring 2019, Prof. Luiz Mendes) has proved to be simultaneously intellectually fulfilling and challenging. I find the process of cataloging resources through implementing the rules and standards outlined as best practices such as AACR2 and RDA, and the framework provided by the BIBFRAME initiative, incredibly enjoyable. The ethical implications corresponding to the ways that resources are contextualized through cataloging, however, present challenges not only to my expertise within the art world, but also to my moral compass as it is seeks to challenge erstwhile Western, hetero- masculine normative structures. I find the discussions surrounding these issues within the field incredibly compelling and hope to work in a capacity where I can continue my work with cataloging and continue engaging with the professional discussions taking place that surround the structures facilitating the work of cataloging. 

<h4>Art in a Broad Context</h4>
<p>The opportunity to bring my creative education and experience to a role defined in generalist terms is also an appealing possibility, as I believe strongly in the importance of interdisciplinarity as a holistic approach to education. I am particularly interested in Collection Development, and the opportunity to complete a course focused on this aspect of librarianship (Fall 2019, Prof. Ulia Gosart) provided the intellectual space to think through the practical aspects of developing and maintaining collections through the application of collection development policies, assessments and budgets. 

<h4>Professional Affiliations & Involvement</h4>
<p>The librarians I worked with at the Arts Library encouraged me to become involved with professional associations, and I have since become a member of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) and Visual Resources Association. As I continue to develop my career in the coming years, I hope to engage more fully with these organizations by taking advantage of opportunities to contribute to book reviews and present posters at annual conferences. I would like to become as involved as I can with larger professional spheres and plan to be involved as much as I can with other professional organizations that serve the art library context. Of particular interest are: Museum Computer Network (MCN), Visual Resources Association (VRA), American Library Association, specifically the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS), Special Libraries Association (SLA), College Art Association (CAA), and the Los Angeles Archivists Collective (LAAC).
<br><br>

One step I have taken toward further involvement with professional organizations is through taking on a leadership role with Artifacts, a student group for UCLA Information Studies students interested in arts librarianship, visual resources, and museum informatics. In my first year of the MLIS program I served as the Treasurer, and am currently President. In this leadership role I have actively worked to recruit members and strengthen the involvement of our leadership roster. Throughout the 2018-19 school year Artifacts has organized and hosted tours and talks, and has collaborated on several of these events with other student groups representing the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) as well as the local ARLIS/NA chapter. 

<h4>Digital Initiatives</h4>
<p>I recently attended a workshop on Python and Git as part of the VRA annual conference. The experience gave me confidence to utilize these platforms more broadly as part of my professional toolkit. I have a great interest in the possibilities of digital strategies for engagement within the context of libraries and museums. Digital initiatives provide an opportunity for expanding access to and creating greater context for collections. This interest has been reinforced through my completion of relevant coursework—Museums in the Digital Age (Prof. Miriam Posner, Spring 2018) and Digital Methods for Research and Scholarship (Prof. Johanna Drucker, Fall 2018). My current work at the Hammer Museum is overseen by Philip Leers, Project Manager for Digital Initiatives. In my capacity as Rights & Reproduction Research Assistant I have developed a system for maintaining the museum’s video archive of Public Programs, and I am implementing a protocol for tracking rights for these digital assets. This work is a crucial contribution to the proper functioning of outward facing digital engagement initiatives. I hope that through continuing to develop the skills and critical framework I have cultivated over the past two years I will be in a position to successfully plan and implement digital projects as part of my professional work in the coming years. 

<h4>Diversity</h4> 
<p>I strongly believe that the inclusion of diverse perspectives within institutional structures are necessary to create value for the systems of knowledge they contain. The ALA’s Library Bill of Rights stipulates that: “A person’s right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin, age, background, or views.” However, biases built into the physical and underlying epistemological structures that libraries have been established upon can be inherently discriminatory, denying use simply through lack of awareness. The library contexts that I am most drawn to—art libraries, academic libraries and special collections—can be among the most difficult to navigate for individuals unfamiliar with insular practices. Creating greater access to these structures and implementing changes to biases built into institutional frameworks is only possible through the inclusion of diverse perspectives contributing to professional conversations. The value of diversity in constructing context and meaning for collections is something that must be actively recognized, and I fully intend to for my work in the LIS field to build upon inclusivity as a means to create meaningful collections in my care.
