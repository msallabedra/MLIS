<h2>1. Issue Summary</h2>
<p>Museum libraries have seen dwindling institutional support in the past decade. Work performed by librarians such as the construction of detailed bibliographies, research guides, and through providing access to their research collections, is creative work worthy of recognition as an important cultural contribution within art museums. In providing context for object collections and exhibitions, art museum libraries can demonstrate their value to the institutions they serve.</p>

<h2>5. Core Project</h2>

Completed for IS 260: Description & Access, Prof. Jonathan Furner, Fall 2017<br>
CONTENTdm Group Project<br>
Team Members: Elisabeth Asher, Lauren Molina, Megan Sallabedra<br><br>

This assignment asked the class to work in groups to create a digital library using CONTENTdm. The library my group created—living in Los Angeles, a collection of items representing our experience of the city—must be accessed by following the link provided by clicking on the title below, and <a href="http://cdm16986.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16986coll57" target="_blank">here</a>.  The report below describes our method and observations on using CONTENTdm as a platform for presenting this collection. As a group project, the report is the result of collaborative writing and represents the voices of all group members. 

<h3><a href="http://cdm16986.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16986coll57" target="_blank">living in Los Angeles</a></h3>

<h4><i>Explanations & Justifications of….</i></h4>

<h4>Decisions made when choosing items</h4>

<p>Our collection, as we intend it, reflects a small slice of what it’s like to live in Los Angeles. Small, necessarily—to think more broadly and attempt to capture what it’s like to live in Los Angeles in general is of course impossible. Operating from our own unique perspectives, we have thus pulled the chosen objects from our private lives. We purposefully tried to assemble a varied collection of objects: records and documents that have emerged from transactions, that we’ve bought or simply come across, and intentionally or unintentionally held onto somewhere in the spaces we keep. We don’t intend to center ourselves in this project, however; rather our aim was to create a collection that begins to describe and define the relationship between a person and where that person lives: how they interact with it, how they move within it. What do we collect that ties us to the place in which we live? Our frame for this line of query is Los Angeles. 

<h4>Making edits to metadata schema & applying vocabulary control</h4>

<p>Before adding any items to our collection through ContentDM, we first took time to discuss which fields were most necessary in describing our objects and if there existed suitable vocabularies for each field. We did choose to use the coverage field to describe the larger (spatial) context of our items; in this case, all objects were given the coverage of “Los Angeles (inhabited place)” as is used in the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. 

<p>We also found that ContentDM doesn’t “know” all of the vocabularies that we wanted to incorporate. In the “Date” field and the “Language” field, then, we did not set vocabulary controls, but we did employ standards/standard forms from W3CDTF profile of ISO 8601 and IETF RFC 5646, respectively. In addition, we elected to add extra fields in the process of editing our collection. For instance, A People’s Guide to Los Angeles has three authors, all of whom appear to have played equal roles in the creation of the text. “Contributor” did not seem to be an apt title for any. Since only one name can appear in the “Creator” field, we chose to solve the problem by adding “Creator - second” and “Creator - third.” We deliberated about the type of a couple of objects as well – the movie ticket stub and the vintage postcard. Ultimately we chose "Text" and “Image" over "Interactive Resource" for these two items. Although an argument can be made for these items needing user interaction in order to be understood, executed, or experienced, these two in particular are items out of use. The ticket stubs are stubs, after all; the postcard has already been sent and received and is now purely an aesthetic object. 

<h4>Vocabulary Control Utilized</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Title: no controlled vocabulary used<</li>
  Title taken from the item itself, if applicable, or assigned based on use and context
  <br><br>
  <li>Subject: AAT (Art & Architecture Thesaurus)</li><br>
  <li>Coverage: TGN (Thesaurus of Geographic Names)</li>
  Specific location “Los Angeles (inhabited place)” selected for all items to situate both the site and context of our collection<br><br>
  <li>Description: no controlled vocabulary used</li>
  A brief narrative description of each item was composed by its user/owner to situate the item within the collection’s context<br><br>
  <li>Creator: ULAN (Union List of Artist Names)</li>
  Although the majority of the creators of objects included in our collection are not listed in ULAN, we chose to use this controlled vocabulary and add terms to our index as a measure of standardization. While our collection is small in scope for the purposes of this exercise, utilizing ULAN as a vocabulary in this field could easily accommodate a wider scope of objects if the collection were to be expanded.<br><br>
  <li>Creator - second: ULAN</li>
  Field added and used where applicable<br><br>
  <li>Creator - third: ULAN</li>
  Field added and used where applicable<br><br>
  <li>Creator - fourth: ULAN</li>
  Field added and used where applicable<br><br>
  <li>Publisher: no controlled vocabulary used; publisher listed where applicable<br><br>
  <li>Contributors: no controlled vocabulary used</li>
  Individual contributors separated by semicolon for uniformity<br><br>
  <li>Date: W3CDTF profile of ISO 8601</li>
  Selected for specificity and uniformity<br><br>
  <li>Type: DCMI (Dublin Core Metadata Standard)</li>
  Few basic types available through this vocabulary allowed us to group items broadly<br><br>
  <li>Format: AAT</li>
  Using the wide scope of AAT vocabulary, we selected a specific format as a descriptive layer to the general type for each item<br><br>
  <li>Source: no controlled vocabulary used; source collection listed for each object</li><br><br>
  <li>Language: IETF RFC 5646</li>
  <li>Relation: no controlled vocabulary used</li>
  Retained in the metadata though not utilized. Field could be of use to describe connections among items in a collection of larger scope.<br><br>
  <li>Audience: no controlled vocabulary used</li>
  Retained in the metadata though not utilized. Field could be of use if collection were to expand to include a broader range of source materials.<br><br>
  <li>Events: AAT</li>
  Specific types of activities pertaining to individual items contribute an additional contextual layer closely linked to use value of each piece in the collection<br><br>
  <li>Permissions: no controlled vocabulary used</li>
  Retained in the metadata though not utilized. An effort to specify permissions could be made if the collection were to be circulated or distributed. 
</ul>
  
<h4><i>Conclusion</i></h4>

<p>Creating a collection using the CONTENTdm site had its challenges but none that couldn’t be solved with patience and collaborative thinking. The first hurdle was simply to familiarize ourselves with CONTENTdm—its language and its quirks. The server, unfortunately constantly lagged while uploading items to be approved, which made the process of approval and indexing somewhat daunting. (We discovered, for example, that CONTENTdm doesn’t think .jpeg and .jpg files are the same thing and will not use a .jpeg file. It instead defaults to a stock place-holder.) Despite the limitations we’ve described, we were able to add metadata easily and effectively define each item within the fields chosen by the site and required to make meaning within the collection.

<h2>7. Advising History</h2>
<br>
<h4>/ / Beverly Lynch</h4>
<p>My assigned advisor when I entered the MLIS program at UCLA in Fall 2017 was Beverly Lynch. Though my interests lie primarily in Art Librarianship, which did not seem to exactly align with Beverly’s expertise, her range of experience and particularly leadership roles within the LIS field gave me a lot of enthusiasm about our academic relationship. I met with her once in Fall 2017, and again in Winter 2018, and though I didn’t have much to talk about in terms of necessary guidance, Beverly’s encouragement left me with confidence in my goals and path forward. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / Miriam Posner</h4>

<p>In my first year of the MLIS program I took two courses with Miriam Posner:
<ul>
  <li>Systems & Infrastructures (IS 270), Winter 2018</li>
  <li>Museums in the Digital Age (IS 289-5), Spring 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>Her approach to teaching resonated with my way of learning, and I felt would be beneficial to the process of completing my course of study. Over Summer 2018 I requested to change advisors so that I could work more closely with Miriam in my second year in the MLIS program. In addition to responding thoughtfully to my numerous email check-ins, I met with Miriam four times. In broad terms, we discussed:
<ul>
  <li>8/21/18: Fall 2018 class schedule; preliminary thoughts on my Issue Paper topic; and accommodations I would need for the 2018-19 school year</li>
  <li>10/10/18:Further ideas for my Issue Paper; setting up a framework for working on my portfolio; Gerd Muehsam student paper award offered through ARLIS/NA</li>
  <li>2/5/19: Class schedule for Winter 2019; setting up expectations for Directed Individual Study for Winter 2019 to work on Issue Paper; planning for Spring 2019 classes</li>
  <li>4/5/19: Portfolio contents and clarification on several components; Directed Individual Study for Spring 2019</li>
</ul>

<h4>Issue Paper</h4>
<p>At the end of Summer 2018 I began discussing my Issue Paper with Miriam. My topic was inspired by a panel discussion on art museum libraries I had attended at the Art Library Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) conference. My in-person and emailed discussions with Miriam at the end of Summer and beginning of Fall 2018 helped to orient my thoughts so that I could begin research with a focus in mind. Over the course of Fall 2018 Miriam provided milestones for progress toward my Issue Paper. As my topic developed I realized I needed more time to follow my research and concentrate on constructing an argument, and Miriam agreed to oversee an independent study in Winter 2019 to facilitate this work. 

<h4>Various Projects</h4>
<p>Miriam provided crucial support for my aspirations outside of work toward specific assignments. Her feedback was incredibly helpful in applying for ARLIS/NA’s Gerd Muehsam student paper award, which I ultimately was honored to receive. Miriam has also agreed to oversee an additional independent study in Spring 2019 so that I can complete work on a project with Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, an artist-run non-circulating library and archive. 

<h4>Support for Personal Commitments</h4>
<p>I became a parent in Spring 2018 and my conversations with Miriam have been instrumental to finding the right balance with and motivation toward my academic and professional goals between new personal obligations. Miriam’s patience, kindness, flexibility and readiness to work with my demands as a new parent within academia have been just as integral to my success as an MLIS candidate as have her guidance in my creative and intellectual labor. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / UCLA Arts Librarians</h4>

<p>Over the course of my MLIS studies at UCLA I also worked as a Graduate Reference Assistant at the Arts Library. The librarians I worked with there—Robert Gore, Diana King, and particularly Janine Henri—have played an important role in providing guidance in my studies and professional development. In addition to sharing their vast knowledge on individual subject specializations, they have allowed me to assist in the coordination of exhibits, LibGuides, acquisitions, and instruction—all necessary skills as an early career librarian. 
<br><br>

<h4>/ / UCLA MLIS Peers</h4>

<p>I believe there is much I can learn not only from established professionals but also from my peers, and with this in mind must also acknowledge the guidance and support I received from Karly Wildenhaus (UCLA MLIS 2018) and Lauren Molina (UCLA MLIS 2019). 

<p>Throughout the 2017-2018 school year Karly offered feedback and advice on courses relevant to my interests, encouraged me to become involved in the local chapter of ARLIS/NA and student group Artifacts, and to apply for professional development opportunities. With an educational and working background similar to my own, Karly’s perspective has been incredibly helpful, especially in challenging me to think outside my comfort zone. 

<p>Lauren and I worked closely and collaboratively throughout our two years of study. We took on two group projects together:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cdm16986.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16986coll57" target="_blank">living in Los Angeles</a>, a digital library built on CONTENTdm (IS 260: Description & Access, Fall 2017)</li>
  <li>KNOW e-publishing, a proposal for a website built for the scholarly community to explain and discuss the implications of digital publishing (IS 213: Libraries and Their Social Role(s), Spring 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>and provided feedback on each others’ work over the course of our time in the MLIS program. Lauren provided key support and motivation to pursue and find the meaning in my ideas.
